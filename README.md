# Clothify — Visual Fashion Recommendation Engine

Clothify is a full-stack application that allows users to upload an image (e.g., a fashion item), automatically generates a descriptive caption using BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining), scrapes relevant product listings based on that caption using Playwright, and presents them in a beautiful frontend interface.

## Features

-  **Image to Text**: Uses [Salesforce BLIP](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) to generate natural-language captions from uploaded images.
-  **Automated Scraping**: Uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to search e-commerce websites and extract relevant results.
-  **Fast API Backend**: Built with Express and Python to bridge the image model and browser automation.
-  **Frontend Integration**: Results are displayed dynamically in a sleek web interface (hosted on Vercel).
